# Employee-Management-System-Using-C

I have designed this system purely in C Language...
This System Uses Linked List Data Structures to store Data For Each Employees...

Here, Each Node Of the Linked List is Treated as an Object (imagingly)

I have preferred Linked Lists Over Array because of its Dynamic Memory Allocation Property,

I have Used Insertion At First Operation in the linked list to achieve O(1) Time Complexity...

As, I Have Taken Employee ID To Be Unique For Each Nodes (i.e Employee)... So, Searching Factor will be this Unique ID

Their Are Many Functionalities in This System Such As:- 

1) Creation / Registering The Employees Initially
2) Insertion / Recruiting of New Employee
3) Deletion / Removing of New Employee
4) Updating The Data Of An Employee
5) Counting The Total Number Of Employees In The Organization At Present
6) Searching Of ID to verify whether the ID is present or, not 
     or, whether their is Any Duplicate ID Present in the Database or, not
